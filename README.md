Assignment for SODV3203

Instructions: 
Assignment 01: Design and Implement a Tic Tac Toe Game
Learning Objectives
●	Create GUIs that contain RelativeLayout, GridLayout, ImageView, and other UI components 
●	Use game logic to implement the game.
External Resources and Code
This assessment is open book-- you can look at the online sources as you see fit. You may copy small pieces of code (1-3 lines that contain semi-colons) from the internet so long as you understand how it works and cite the source in a comment. You may not use any external libraries other than those covered in class. As per the academic honesty policy, you may not copy code (even with modification) from other students, or from other sites on the internet. You may not consult other students or look at their code. You may not share your code with other students. Any submission that violates the academic honesty policy will be penalized.
Overview and Submission Requirements
Your task is to work individually to create a simple Android game. Submit your entire project in compressed *.zip format into the d2l submission page.
Game Overview

Tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner (Source: Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). 
In this assignment, your app will design all required UI components (as generic as possible to fit different screens sizes and different android versions) and will also implement the game logic.
  
Hints
The following information should be helpful for you:
1.	Create a Java class that contains relevant information. Create methods to implement all of your expected features.
2.	Create the Game initially for a specific screen and a specific phone only. Indicate your virtual emulator used for building the game as a comment in the Java source code. 
3.	You will need to use a combination of different Layouts with image resources and images.
4.	Once your game is working well as per your expectation, try to come up with a generic design that automatically fills screens when you run your app across different devices.
5.	For animation, you may take help from the following website: https://codinginfinite.com/basic-android-animation-example/

Marking Criteria
UI Design (5 points)
1.	Buttons are responding well, images and icons are well placed with proper margin and padding as per requirements.                 (1 Point)
2.	Your game have animated icons/buttons.                 (1 Point)
3.	ID for all UI’s are meaningful and readable.              (1 Point)
4.	Proper use of string, and image resources.               (1 Point)
5.	UI is consistent across many devices.                       (1 Point)  

Game Logic (5 points)
1.	Your game is playable (winning condition is there).	   (1 Point)
2.	The code is readable and variables are well defined. Naming for classes, methods, and variables is appropriate.                       (1 Point)
3.	Game doesn’t crash while playing.                             (1 Point)
4.	Functionality decomposed into classes and methods. Game logic and function description is there as a Java Comment (// or /*…  …*/.)    (1 Point)
5.	There are options to restart the game after a win or a draw. (1 Point)
